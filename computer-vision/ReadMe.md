# 👁️ Computer Vision Projects

This repository contains a collection of **computer vision projects** developed in **Python**, using libraries such as **OpenCV, NumPy, scikit-learn, Tkinter, and PIL**.  
Each project addresses a specific problem, ranging from real-time coin classification to object segmentation and character recognition.

## 📂 Projects Overview

### 1. Coin Classification & Counting (with GUI)-Project_1
A real-time system to detect and classify Colombian coins based on contour area.  
Includes a **Tkinter GUI** and **ESP32 communication** to control a servo motor that physically sorts the coins.

---

### 2. Dental Image Classification (Teeth Recognition)-Project_2
Automated classification of teeth (Canine, Central, Lateral) from images and video streams.  
Uses **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models** with preprocessing, ROI segmentation, and visualization.

---

### 3. Image Segmentation & Object Counting-Project_3
A set of smaller projects demonstrating segmentation techniques:
- **3.a**: Coin segmentation with random colors.  
- **3.b**: Coin counting based on pixel area.  
- **3.c**: Bar counting and measuring distances between them (in pixels).

---

### 4. Coin Counting in Video Streams-Project_4
Processes video input to count coins crossing a virtual line.  
Implements **HSV color-space filtering** and motion-based detection.

---

### 5. Fruit Classification (with GUI)-Project_5
A Tkinter-based application for fruit recognition.  
Supports object segmentation and classification of fruits such as **Lemon, Onion, Potato, and Tamarillo**, with side-by-side visualization of original, binary, and contour images.

---

### 6. ROI Zoom & Image Processing Tool-Project_6
GUI application for dynamic ROI (Region of Interest) selection with adjustable zoom.  
Includes **median filtering** and **erosion** for segmentation enhancement, with a multi-panel display.

---

### 7. License Plate Character Recognition-Project_7
End-to-end recognition of alphanumeric characters from vehicle license plates.  
Employs **MLP classifiers** for per-character recognition and reconstruction of the full plate number.
